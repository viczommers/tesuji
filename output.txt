2025-04-13 03:31:32.993 | INFO | portia.portia:_execute_plan_run:588 - Step output - To filter the list of doctors for low consultation prices and minimal time to next availability, I will consider the following criteria:

1. **Low Consultation Price**: I will prioritize doctors with the lowest price or price range.
2. **Minimal Time to Next Availability**: I will calculate the number of days until the next available appointment and prioritize those with the shortest wait time.

Here is the filtered list based on these criteria:

### Filtered Doctors:
1. **Dr Kalpesh Besherdas**
   - **Specialty**: General (internal) medicine
   - **Price**: £230 (lowest price in the list)
   - **Next Availability**: 1 day (2025-04-14)

2. **Dr Panagiotis Kottaridis**
... (truncated 2 lines) ...
   - **Next Availability**: 1 day (2025-04-14)

3. **Dr Daniel Krell**
   - **Specialty**: Medical oncology
   - **Price**: £350
   - **Next Availability**: 5 days (2025-04-18)

4. **Mr Jonathan Hughes**
   - **Specialty**: Ear, Nose and Throat surgery
   - **Price**: £300
   - **Next Availability**: 3 days (2025-04-16)

### Notes:
- Dr Kalpesh Besherdas and Dr Panagiotis Kottaridis are the top recommendations due to their low prices and immediate availability (1 day).
- Dr Daniel Krell and Mr Jonathan Hughes are included as secondary options based on their relatively short wait times and reasonable prices.

2025-04-13 11:51:00.675 | INFO | portia.portia:_execute_plan_run:588 - Step output - To filter the list of doctors based on low consultation price and short time to next availability, I will prioritize those with lower prices and earlier availability. Here are the top three suitable doctors:

### Suggested Doctors:
1. **Dr Michael Mendall**  
   - **Specialty:** Gastroenterology  
   - **Rating:** 98%  
   - **Price:** £250 - £300  
   - **Availability:** 5 days (2025-04-18)  
   - **Reason:** Dr Mendall offers one of the lowest prices (£250 - £300) and has relatively short availability (5 days). His high rating (98%) further supports his suitability.

2. **Mr Sam Singh**  
   - **Specialty:** Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery  
   - **Rating:** 100%  
   - **Price:** £290  
   - **Availability:** 3 days (2025-04-16)  
   - **Reason:** Mr Singh has the lowest fixed price (£290) and the shortest availability (3 days). His perfect rating (100%) makes him an excellent choice.

3. **Dr Mark Harries**  
   - **Specialty:** Medical Oncology  
   - **Rating:** 100%  
   - **Price:** £300  
   - **Availability:** 12 days (2025-04-25)  
   - **Reason:** Dr Harries has a competitive price (£300) and a perfect rating (100%). While his availability is slightly longer (12 days), his combination of price and rating makes him a strong candidate.

### Justification:
These three doctors were selected based on their low consultation prices and shorter availability times, while maintaining high ratings. They represent a balance of affordability, accessibility, and quality of care.
