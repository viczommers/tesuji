2025-04-13 03:31:32.993 | INFO | portia.portia:_execute_plan_run:588 - Step output - To filter the list of doctors for low consultation prices and minimal time to next availability, I will consider the following criteria:

1. **Low Consultation Price**: I will prioritize doctors with the lowest price or price range.
2. **Minimal Time to Next Availability**: I will calculate the number of days until the next available appointment and prioritize those with the shortest wait time.

Here is the filtered list based on these criteria:

### Filtered Doctors:
1. **Dr Kalpesh Besherdas**
   - **Specialty**: General (internal) medicine
   - **Price**: £230 (lowest price in the list)
   - **Next Availability**: 1 day (2025-04-14)

2. **Dr Panagiotis Kottaridis**
... (truncated 2 lines) ...
   - **Next Availability**: 1 day (2025-04-14)

3. **Dr Daniel Krell**
   - **Specialty**: Medical oncology
   - **Price**: £350
   - **Next Availability**: 5 days (2025-04-18)

4. **Mr Jonathan Hughes**
   - **Specialty**: Ear, Nose and Throat surgery
   - **Price**: £300
   - **Next Availability**: 3 days (2025-04-16)

### Notes:
- Dr Kalpesh Besherdas and Dr Panagiotis Kottaridis are the top recommendations due to their low prices and immediate availability (1 day).
- Dr Daniel Krell and Mr Jonathan Hughes are included as secondary options based on their relatively short wait times and reasonable prices.
